### Team Agreement
We, the undersigned members of our Team, now mutually agree and solemnly commit to the following stipulations and guidelines outlined in this agreement. This document serves as an informal contract, underscoring our collective responsibility and dedication to the agreed-upon standards and practices. Each member pledges to adhere to these principles and provisions to the best of their ability to pursue a cooperative, efficient, and productive team environment.

#### Overview
The team is committed to fostering a cooperative and productive atmosphere. We've established guidelines for effective communication, structured teamwork, and high-quality work output.

We are currently working on creating a ChromeExtension, a  designed to replicate the messaging and user functionalities of Discord. Chatterbox's frontend is designed with React.js, CSS and Tailwind for layout and styling while the backend is constructed with Firebase. 

#### Meeting Frequency and Communication
- We will hold weekly meetings to discuss progress, plan future tasks, and address any issues.
- All team members agree to respond to emails and texts as soon as possible, typically within 24 hours.

#### Version Control and Issue Tracking
- We will use Git for version control to manage our codebase efficiently.
- Every team member agrees to commit with clear messages and pull the latest changes before starting their work.
- This practice will help us track progress, manage issues effectively, and maintain a history of changes with timestamps.
- For bugs and Git issues, if an issue or bug is found in someone elseâ€™s code, we will put up an issue on the repository with the appropriate label (severe, moderate, minor) so that it can be addressed promptly.

#### Testing Strategies
- Each team member tests their code to ensure it meets project expectations.
- Before committing changes to Git, we encourage showing the output to other team members for a preliminary review.

#### Project Preferences
- Our preferred projects (in order of preference) are Discord Clone, Event Ticketing, and E-learning.

#### Lab Section Preferences
- Our preferred lab sections are (in order of preference) L06, L03, and L09.
